Hello, thank you for visiting my website. I am Carelton University Alumini from the School of Computer Science. I completed a Bachelor of Science Honours degree with high distinction where my area of specialization was Computer & Internet Security. I have also completed a minor in Neuroscience & Mental Health, specializing in [Neuropsychopharmacology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychopharmacology).


Having completed my academic career (for now), I work in IT and strive to learn more about cybersecurity in my personal time. My other hobbies include video games, TTRPGs, and board games, which I love for the simple fact of learning new rule sets, and understanding how to apply them in the most efficient and effective manner. I also love reading and watching films, particularly science fiction stories, which often serve as idealistic or nihilistic interpretations on how technology can help or hinder humanity. 

##### Here are some fun facts about myself:

* My favourite color is orange.
* I've never broken a bone in my body.
* I have two cats, Sirius & Goblin.
* My guilty pleasure is playing Wordle.
